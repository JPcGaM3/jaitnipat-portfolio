# Casey Parker · Portfolio

A responsive single-page portfolio for a multidisciplinary product designer and frontend engineer.

## Features

- Hero, about, skills, projects, experience, testimonials, and contact sections
- Dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection and persistence
- Responsive navigation with smooth scrolling and mobile menu
- Project filtering by vertical (SaaS, nonprofit, consumer)
- Intersection-based reveal animations for content cards

## Getting started

This project is a static site—no build tooling required.

```bash
# open the `index.html` file in your browser
open index.html
```

On Windows, use `start index.html`; on Linux, use `xdg-open index.html`.

## Customization

All copy and styling is intentionally organized:

- Update content directly in [`index.html`](./index.html)
- Adjust the design in [`styles/main.css`](./styles/main.css)
- Modify interactions in [`scripts/main.js`](./scripts/main.js)

Enjoy building!
